Welcome to Rimåe RPG's Role Play Logue 

Our system is mainly binary in order to simplify the role play process, as well as 
highlight the beauty of the natural photography featured in our website. 


This portion of the website houses our role play platform, which is where role play stories are written, 
born, and logged. Characters develop here, having been born into role play or passed through role play, 
then play the spirit of their character. There is no limit to what we may play outside of our rule, let
imagination run, as the wolves do. Sing, as the wolves do.











Please do not abuse our platform. Please follow Role Play Rules, found on main Rimåe website.

Failure to follow rules will result in immediate dismissal from Rimåe.
